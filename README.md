# Dungeon Unleashed

"Dungeon Unleashed" is a 2D adventure game based on the C++ Game Framework developed by Professor Woei-Kae Chen. In the game, the player must kill all monsters in various dungeons to enter the next dungeon, step by step, until the last dungeon and kill BOSS.

Players must roll to avoid the monster's attack, and improve their attributes through scene interaction.
